**Tachy** is an interactive chatbot application that combines a user-friendly graphical interface with robust backend processing using natural language processing and mathematical problem-solving capabilities.

## Features

- **Interactive GUI**: Utilizes `tkinter` for a responsive and intuitive graphical user interface.
- **Local Database Storage**: Employs `sqlite3` for storing and retrieving interactive Q&A pairs, enhancing learning from past interactions.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Integrates `spacy` for advanced text understanding, which helps in matching user queries with accurate answers.
- **Mathematical Problem Solving**: Features `SymPy` for handling and solving a wide range of mathematical questions.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learns new answers from users by requesting information it does not already know, thereby continuously expanding its knowledge base.
- **Question Similarity Matching**: Uses `TfidfVectorizer` and `cosine_similarity` from `scikit-learn` to determine the most relevant answers from past interactions.
- **Editable Responses**: Allows users to directly edit responses, facilitating real-time learning and accuracy improvements.
